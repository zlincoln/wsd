					<h1>Getting Started with HTML/CSS</h1>
					<p>Coding can be really frustrating to get the hang of, but once you get started, it can be a lot of fun!  With HTML, the most important thing to get a handle on first is understanding the difference between block-level and inline elements.  Once you are comfortable with all the tags that are available to you and which category they fall under, CSS will be your next hurdle.</p>
					<p>CSS can be challenging because there is sooooo many different styles that can be applied to elements.  The toughest however will eventually prove to be the structural styles such as float, clear, position, and display.  You will learn about these in time, but one big pointer - <strong>if you have a container with a child or two that is floated or positioned absolute, it will collapse!</strong> Do yourself a favor and lookup how to 'clearfix'.</p>
					<h2>Bootstrap &amp; Foundation</h2>
					<p>Once you feel somewhat comfortable, you can save yourself a lot of time by learning how to use a framework.  Frameworks are preset CSS class libraries that you can use to build pages really quickly.  Right now two frameworks are really hot - Bootstrap and Foundation.  I recommend <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>, the documentation on how to use it is great!</p>

					<h1>What You Should Know When Looking For a Job</h1>
					<p>Organizations look for web developers who are psyched about what they do and hungry for more.  As a fast moving industry, developers always have to be willing to learn more, and know where they can go to pick up the knowledge.  So, being comfortable with your skillset is important, but more so that you show you are willing to find answers to a problem if you don't know them - <em>and you recognize that you don't know them</em>.  Believe me, this will get you really far in an interview.</p>
					<h2>Where to Find These Answers</h2>
					<p>Google!  Google is your best friend in the whole world.  Often if your search terms include the issue you are having, you will find someone on the net who had the same issue, and someone with more knowledge who helped solve their issue.  Often this takes place on a site called 'stack-overflow' which is a site dedicated to Q&amp;A.  You always have to take the answerer's solution with a grain of salt, but with entry-level questions, you can be pretty confident that they know what they are talking about.</p>
